=head1 NAME

RT - Request Tracker

=head1 SYNOPSIS

A fully featured request tracker package

=head1 description

=head2 INITIALIZATION

=head2 load_config

Load RT's config file.  First, the site configuration file
(F<RT_SiteConfig.pm>) is loaded, in order to establish overall site
settings like hostname and name of RT instance.  Then, the core
configuration file (F<RT_Config.pm>) is loaded to set fallback values
for all settings; it bases some values on settings from the site
configuration file.

In order for the core configuration to not override the site's
settings, the function C<Set> is used; it only sets values if they
have not been set already.

=cut

sub load_config {
    $Config = RT::Model::Config->new;

    #    require RT::I18N;
    RT::I18N->init;
}

sub config {
    my $self = shift;
    if (!$Config) {
        RT->load_config;
    }
    return $Config;
}

=head2 init

L<configures plugins|init_plugins>.

=cut

sub init {

    #    CheckPerlRequirements();
    #Get a database connection
    init_plugin_paths();

    $System = RT::System->new();

    init_plugins();
    require RT::Lorzy;
    # enable approval subsystem
    require RT::Approval;

}

# Signal handlers
## This is the default handling of warnings and die'ings in the code
## (including other used modules - maybe except for errors catched by
## Mason).  It will log all problems through the standard logging
## mechanism (see above).

sub check_perl_requirements {
    if ( $^V < 5.008003 ) {
        die sprintf
            "RT requires Perl v5.8.3 or newer.  Your current Perl is v%vd\n",
            $^V;
    }

    local ($@);
    eval {
        my $x = '';
        my $y = \$x;
        require Scalar::Util;
        Scalar::Util::weaken($y);
    };
    if ($@) {
        die <<"EOF";

RT requires the Scalar::Util module be built with support for  the 'weaken'
function. 

It is sometimes the case that operating system upgrades will replace 
a working Scalar::Util with a non-working one. If your system was working
correctly up until now, this is likely the cause of the problem.

Please reinstall Scalar::Util, being careful to let it build with your C 
compiler. Ususally this is as simple as running the following command as
root.

    perl -MCPAN -e'install Scalar::Util'

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 config

Returns the current L<config object|RT::Model::Config>.

Method can be called as class method.

=cut

=head2 system

Returns the current system object L<RT::System>.

=cut

sub system { return RT::System->new }

=head2 system_user

Returns the system user's object, it's object of
L<RT::CurrentUser> class that represents the system.

=cut

sub system_user {
    my $system_user = RT::CurrentUser->new( name => 'RT_System' );
    $system_user->is_superuser(1);
    return $system_user;

}

=head2 Nobody

Returns object of Nobody. It's object of L<RT::CurrentUser> class
that represents a user who can own ticket and nothing else.

=cut

sub nobody {
    unless ($nobody) {

        Carp::confess "Could not load 'Nobody' User. This usually indicates a corrupt or missing RT database"
                unless $nobody->id;
    }

    return $nobody
}

=head2 Plugins
